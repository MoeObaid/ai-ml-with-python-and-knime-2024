# 🛒 Retail Product Detection Using YOLOv8
📌 AI & Machine Learning Project (2024)  
This project focuses on detecting supermarket retail products using YOLOv8 for object detection. It utilizes two datasets (Beverages & Fruits) and performs real-time inference on videos.  

# 📷 Project Overview
🎯 Goal  
The aim of this project is to build an AI-powered retail product detection model to identify items in a supermarket video using YOLOv8.  

# ✅ Key Features:

Trained YOLOv8 on merged datasets (Beverage + Fruit products).  
Real-time object detection on images and videos.  
Optimized for CPU (since my GPU is weak).  
High accuracy & performance tuning using YOLOv8X.  
👨‍🏫 Course: Artificial Intelligence  
🎓 Instructor: Kholed Langsari  

# 📂 Dataset Information
